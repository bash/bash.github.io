Hey, I'm Tau. I'm interested in:
* Software Development (Rust, C#, Web Stuffs, …)
* Software Architecture (Clean Architecture, API Design)
* Functional Programming
* Parsers

I'm currently studying mathematics at the [University of Zurich][UZH].
In my spare time I enjoy working on side projects, contributing to open source and playing
story driven or puzzle games.
